<h3> Academic Aspirations 
<img src= "uga.arch.jpeg" alt="uga arch" style="border:3px solid black" class='img1' height="175" width="300">
</h3>
<p class='special'> I am hoping to eventually be a practcing clinical psychologist so that she can help others process trauma and cope with mental health. I'm very interested in advanced diagnoses such as schizophrenia, DID, and PTSD. These are all incredible examples of how our brain takes trauma and dissonace and turns it into something more manageable in order to cope. The many different manifestations of early childhood trauma and expereince are very interesting to me. I have been looking at several different Grad School options, most of which are not in Georgia. Ideally, I would attend the University of Washington, although I've also been looking at the University of Chicago and the University of California schools (Los Angeles and Berkeley). Because I am so passionate about psychology and the research currently going on in the field, I see my future being very career-focused. Although I'd love to have a family and devote time to such things, I also know that I want to make an impact on the world through my work. I currently attend the University of Georgia (the famous UGA Arch is shown to the left), here I study Psychology and Social Work. </p>
<h3> Life Aspirations </h3>
<p class='special'> I hope to live somehwere in the Pacific Northwest. I love the United States' many beautiful national parks, and it has always been a bucket list item for me to visit Olympic National Park, and other beautiful locations nearby such as Glacier National Park, The Redwoods, and North Cascades National Park. I think that Seattle is such a unique city, which has many good oppurtunities and most importantly: good vibes. I would love to have a family, preferably a daughter that my future husband/partner and I will take care of. I also love animals, and would definitley need a pet dog if I were toe ver settle down and get a house. I aspire to travel a lot when I'm older. I hope that I can get a job which allows this, or get a job which allows me enough time off so that I can see the world.   </p>
